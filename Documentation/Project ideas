  1. We can use nearby internships and careers on other websites as a dataset. We could have 
  internships post on our site or we could find some from bigger sites.  
  2. Our customers would be students in college or new grads trying to find a job. 
  3. It's helping people find internships. The problem that it fixes is finding oppurtunities 
  for people who need experience or money. It's important because it's hard for people to find
  jobs without the resources or websites that have them all on one page.
  4. The product vision is to help people locate jobs in an efficient manner and give them 
  whatever resources they need. It's useful to society because it'll help people get employed
  and help jobs fill up positions. 
  5. Rate/Review Experiences, Compare Jobs, Filtering, etc
